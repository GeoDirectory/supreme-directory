== Description ==

A Supreme Child for Directory Starter, check out this video to see how easy it is to setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MXfot6buMc

Supreme Directory is the sleekest and faster loading theme for GeoDirectory. It is a Child Theme of our free theme Directory Starter and it is free as well.

Supreme requires minimal setup, it features an eye catching home page design with a full screen featured area boosting parallax effect.

Each page can be built using popular Page Builders, the one we tested the most and we recommend is Beaver Builder.

All add-ons play well with Supreme and we made sure that BuddyPress would be compatible too. Supreme is 100% responsive and work perfectly with all devices.
